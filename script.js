// I understand how for loops work. The first placement in the parenthesis is where the for loop starts, the second is the maximum number, and the third placement is i++. In the brackets is the code you would place for the length of that loop. If there are no numbers, then a for loop keeps looping until it is false.

// for(establish starting point of index and index variable; any stopping condition which returns true/false; increment index)
for (i = 0; i <= 19; i++) {
  console.log("Regular Loop: the current index is " + i);
}

// infinite loop example
// for (i = 0; i < i + 1; i++) {
//   console.log("Infinite Loop: the current index is " + i);
// }
